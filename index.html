                    Massage is one of the oldest and most natural forms of healing, used to soothe sore muscles, improve circulation, and promote relaxation. It’s no wonder that massage is becoming an increasingly popular form of prenatal care, as it can provide many benefits for both the mother and baby. But how often should you get a massage during pregnancy? And what are the best types of massage for pregnant women? Read on to find out.

                <p>
                    Most experts agree that massage is safe during all stages of pregnancy, and can be beneficial for both the mother and baby. Research has shown that massage can help reduce stress, lower blood pressure, relieve pain, improve sleep quality, and boost moods.
